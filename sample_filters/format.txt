The format for the filters are as follows:
N filter_tap_1 filter_tap_2 ... filter_tap_N*(N-1) filter_tap_N*N

where:
	N is the length of each of the dimensions
	N is odd
	filter_tap_1 through filter_tap_N*N increases fastest in the x dimension (columns) and slowest in the y dimension (rows).
	The filter taps are real numbers
	The tap in the centre of this matrix should be placed over the pixel to which the resulting value is to be  written out
	Engineers: this differs slightly from your normal definition of a convolution, please be careful. The boundary condition is also slightly different to a normal convolution.
